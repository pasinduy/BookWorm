### Online Library Management System (OLMS) - README

Welcome to the Online Library Management System (OLMS) project! This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive solution for managing library resources and services in an online environment. Built using Hibernate, OLMS offers a robust platform for library administrators, librarians, and users to efficiently manage and access library resources.

- **Borrowing and Returning:** Enable users to borrow and return books seamlessly. Track borrowing history and manage overdue fines.
- **Search and Filter:** Allow users to search for books based on title, author, genre, or ISBN. Implement filters for refining search results.
- **Reservation System:** Enable users to reserve books that are currently unavailable.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports on book inventory, borrowing statistics, and member activity.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Java:** The core programming language used for developing OLMS.
- **Hibernate:** An ORM framework for mapping Java objects to database tables and simplifying database interactions.
- **MySQL:** The relational database management system used for storing library data.
- **JavaFX:** The graphical user interface toolkit used for building the front-end of OLMS.
- **Maven:** A build automation tool used for managing project dependencies and building the project.
